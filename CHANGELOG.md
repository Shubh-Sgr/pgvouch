# Changelog

All notable changes to PgVouch. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) (0.x: minor versions may change behavior).

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Releases are listed in the official MCP Registry automatically.** After a version is approved on npm, the release workflow publishes `server.json` to the registry, logged in with the workflow's GitHub identity (no stored token), using a pinned and checksum-verified `mcp-publisher`. A unit test keeps `server.json` in step with `package.json`.

## [0.4.4] - 2026-10-04

### Added
- **Listed in the official MCP Registry** as `io.github.Shubh-Sgr/pgvouch`: `server.json` describes how MCP clients start PgVouch (`npx pgvouch mcp` over stdio) and its settings (`SOURCE_DATABASE_URL` and `TARGET_DATABASE_URL` required, `PGVOUCH_LLM` optional), and `package.json` names that entry (`mcpName`), which the registry checks.

### Changed
- README: npm provenance has been on since 0.4.1 (the security section still said "from the next release on").

## [0.4.3] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed
- **Names that are Postgres keywords made generated SQL invalid.** Only a short hand-written list of reserved words was quoted, so a table or column named `case`, `window`, `both`, `binary`, `current_date` (53 keywords in all) produced `ALTER TABLE window ...`: `plan`, `shadow` and the MCP `plan_migration` failed with a syntax error, and `rewrite` produced a script that couldn't run. Every keyword Postgres itself quotes is now quoted (the full list from PostgreSQL 13 to 17), and a test checks that each one gives SQL Postgres' parser accepts.
- **Shadow runs failed on targets with row-level security policies for named roles.** A schema dump has no roles, so copying a target with `CREATE POLICY ... TO app_user` failed with "role does not exist", and shadow runs (and so LLM plans) couldn't run at all. The roles named by policies on the target and source are now created in the shadow container first, as placeholders without login or privileges.
- **Shadow runs failed for plans that read a partitioned table**, e.g. a view over it ("permission denied"). Partitioned tables and partitions weren't handed to the plan role, because a rule meant only for sequences owned by a column skipped them.
- A missing or extra materialized view is described as "materialized view", not "view".

### Changed
- **Receipts no longer contain row values.** Differing rows are listed by primary key and changed column names, like the MCP tools: a receipt is meant to be attached to tickets and audits, and row values can be personal data. `pgvouch receipt --include-values` keeps them.

## [0.4.2] - 2026-10-02

### Fixed
- **The rollback of a row-level security step could leave the table forced.** Plans set both RLS flags (on/off and forced) even when only one differed, so the suggested rollback flipped the other one too (e.g. turning RLS on, then rolling back, ended with `FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`). A step now changes only the flags that differ, and its rollback restores the target's previous state exactly.

## [0.4.1] - 2026-10-02

### Added
- **The Docker image is multi-arch (amd64 and arm64)**, so it runs natively on Apple Silicon and ARM servers instead of under emulation.
- **Releases are published from GitHub Actions with npm provenance** (trusted publishing, no npm token stored): each version on npm links to the commit and workflow run that built it. They are staged first and go live only after a maintainer approves them with 2FA, so CI alone can't publish a version.
- README: what PgVouch can touch (network, processes, files), for security reviews and supply-chain scanner reports.

### Changed
- A test for hostile HTML in PR review output now uses case-insensitive substring checks (CodeQL `js/bad-tag-filter`); it is stricter than the regex it replaces.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-10-02

### Added
- **Drift detection for the objects around the tables:** views and materialized views, functions and procedures, triggers (including a trigger that is disabled on the target), enum types, extensions, and row-level security (policies and the per-table on/off/forced state). Before, a missing audit trigger or a dropped RLS policy was reported as "no drift". The rules plan fixes them in dependency order (extensions and enums, tables, functions, views, triggers, policies, then RLS on), replaces triggers and policies atomically in one `BEGIN ... COMMIT`, and holds back drops of extra objects as contract steps. Extensions, changed materialized views and enums with extra labels are left as named manual steps.
- **Sequence health check in `verify`:** every identity/serial sequence on the target must be ahead of the largest value in its column. A sequence left behind after copying data makes the next INSERT fail with a duplicate key; `verify` now reports it (exit code 1) with the `setval` statement that fixes it. Also in the MCP tool `verify_data`.
- **Lag tolerance in `verify` (`--recheck <rounds>`, `--recheck-delay <seconds>`)**, for a target that is still being replicated to. Rows written a moment ago on the source differ on the target only because they are in flight. A recheck looks at the same differences again after a delay, in a new snapshot, and reports only those that never caught up; it rechecks only what the first check found, so new writes don't keep a table failing. Rows still differing whose source row also changed between checks are marked "source still changing". Chunks with too many differences to list, and tables without a primary key, are rechecked by hash. Also on the MCP tools `verify_data` and `find_differing_rows` (`recheck`, `recheckDelaySeconds`). Tested against real logical replication with live writes: without recheck 7 of 10 runs reported rows in flight as differences; with `--recheck 2 --recheck-delay 1`, 0 of 10, and the real difference was found every time.
- `verify --schema <names...>` and a `schemas` input on the MCP tool `verify_data` (unknown schemas are an error, like `diff --schema`).
- `verify` notes when row-level security limits which rows the read-only role can see, so "identical" isn't mistaken for "every row compared".
- CI runs the integration tests and the lock-accuracy eval on PostgreSQL 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17. The demo databases take `PG_VERSION` (default 16).
- Lock rules for `CREATE TRIGGER`, `ENABLE/DISABLE TRIGGER`, `DROP TRIGGER`, `CREATE/ALTER/DROP POLICY`, `ENABLE/DISABLE/FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`, views, materialized views, functions, enum types and extensions, each measured against `pg_locks` in the lock-accuracy eval.
- Eval scenarios 24-32 (views, functions, triggers, enums, extensions, RLS, a sequence left behind its data).

### Changed
- **The LLM planner is off by default** (`PGVOUCH_LLM=none`). Nothing is sent to any model, local or remote, unless you set `PGVOUCH_LLM=ollama` or `gemini`.
- Shadow runs use a Postgres image of the target's major version (a newer server can't be dumped by an older `pg_dump`), and the plan role also owns copied functions and types, so plans can replace them.
- Drops of extra objects that aren't data (views, functions, triggers, policies, enum types, sequences) are contract-phase steps now, commented out unless `--allow-data-loss`.

### Fixed
- **Node 21.0–21.6 passed the `engines` check but couldn't run the CLI** (`process.loadEnvFile` arrived in 21.7). `engines` is now `^20.12.0 || >=21.7.0`.
- **Text primary keys could give false mismatches between servers with different collations** (another collation, or the same one on a different glibc/ICU version, common in cloud moves). Key ordering and chunk ranges now use byte order (`COLLATE "C"`) for text-like keys; integer, uuid and timestamp keys are unchanged.

## [0.3.2] - 2026-09-30

### Changed
- **README: a "Get started" section with two clear paths.** Option A uses the npm package: try it on a migration file with no database, install, point it at your databases, then the full command list as `pgvouch <command>`. Option B clones the repo for the seeded demo databases and the step-by-step walkthrough. No code changes.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Published on npm.** Install with `npm install -g pgvouch`, or run any command with `npx pgvouch <command>`. MCP clients can start the server with `npx -y pgvouch mcp`, so registering it no longer needs a clone and a build.
- **The installed CLI reads `./.env`**, like `npm run cli` does. Variables already set in the environment take precedence. The MCP server still takes its settings only from the MCP client config.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-30

### Changed
- **Renamed from DriftGuard to PgVouch** (the npm name `driftguard` belongs to an unrelated project). Breaking for existing setups: the CLI is now `pgvouch`, environment variables are `PGVOUCH_*` (was `DRIFTGUARD_*`), the demo read-only role is `pgvouch_ro`, the MCP server name is `pgvouch`, and the Docker image is `ghcr.io/<owner>/pgvouch`. Recreate the demo databases with `npm run db:down && npm run db:up`.
- **License changed from MIT to Apache 2.0**, which adds an explicit patent grant from contributors. A `NOTICE` file ships with the npm package and the Docker image.

### Fixed
- **Type-change rewrite kept indexes and constraints on the old column.** After the expand/contract swap, a foreign key, CHECK, UNIQUE constraint or index on the column stayed on `<col>_old`, so the rules plan failed its own shadow run (e.g. `transactions_merchant_id_fkey` ended up on `merchant_id_old`). They are now copied to the new column without blocking (index `CONCURRENTLY`, FK/CHECK `NOT VALID` + `VALIDATE`, UNIQUE via a concurrent index + `USING INDEX`) and take their original names in the swap. A primary key, exclusion constraints and foreign keys from other tables stay a named manual step. Two new eval scenarios cover it (23 in total, 19/19 rules plans pass the shadow run).
- **The column swap is atomic.** The two renames now run inside one `BEGIN ... COMMIT`, so there is no moment where the column name doesn't exist.
- **The plan validator accepted any `DROP`.** `DROP SCHEMA ... CASCADE`, `DROP VIEW`, `DROP FUNCTION` etc. passed and were rendered as normal steps. Only `DROP INDEX` and `DROP TABLE` are allowed now.
- **Typos gave misleading answers.** An unknown schema (`diff --schema typo`) reported "No schema drift"; an unknown table (`verify --table typo`, MCP `find_differing_rows`) reported "DIFFERENCES FOUND". Both are now errors. `--chunk-size` and `--max-rows` reject invalid numbers up front, and `receipt-verify` says clearly when a file isn't a receipt.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-29

### Added
- **Lock-queue preflight (F13):** `pgvouch preflight <file>` and the MCP tool `check_lock_queue` answer "is it safe to run this right now?". They compare the lock each statement needs with the target's live `pg_locks` / `pg_stat_activity`, using Postgres' full lock conflict table: sessions holding or already waiting for a conflicting lock, and, for `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, every open transaction. Never returns other sessions' query text and never terminates sessions. Works with "limited visibility" without `pg_read_all_stats`.
- **PR review (F14):** `pgvouch review <files...> --format markdown|json|text` (offline) and a GitHub Action (`action.yml`) that writes the lock analysis and safe rewrites of the migrations a pull request changes to the job summary and one PR comment.
- `PGVOUCH_SHADOW_VERIFY=on|off` (default `on`).
- A demo GIF in the README.

### Changed
- **LLM plans must pass a shadow run to be accepted.** Before, the validator alone decided, which proved plans safe but not complete (measured: 0/3 accepted llama3.2 plans passed the shadow run). A shadow failure is sent back to the LLM for its retry; if the shadow can't run (e.g. no Docker), the rules plan is used and the reason is reported. Plans now include `acceptedBy`, `fallbackReason` and a `stage` per attempt.
- **Shadow runs treat plan SQL as untrusted:** it runs as a non-superuser role (`pg_read_file`, `COPY ... PROGRAM` are denied), with a per-statement client-side timeout, and the container is limited to 256 MB, 1 CPU and 256 processes. Ctrl-C removes the container.
- The MCP server now has 7 tools (`check_lock_queue` is new). With an LLM configured, `plan_migration` may start a short-lived local container for the shadow run.
- The demo seed grants `pg_read_all_stats` to `pgvouch_ro` (reset with `npm run db:down && npm run db:up`).
- The demo databases' bind address is configurable (`DB_BIND`, default `127.0.0.1`); CI uses it so shadow runs work on Linux runners.
- Node 22 LTS, updated CI actions, Dependabot for npm and GitHub Actions (minor and patch updates).

### Fixed
- The demo databases listen on `127.0.0.1` only.

### Not re-measured
- The LLM planner numbers in the README are from v0.1.0 (validator-only acceptance). They have not been re-measured with the shadow gate yet.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-29

First public release: schema introspection and drift detection, chunked checksum verification with bisection to the exact differing rows, lock-impact analysis, safe rewrites, a guarded LLM planner with a rules-only fallback, shadow runs, reversibility tags, hashed receipts, an MCP server with 6 read-only tools, and an eval suite.
